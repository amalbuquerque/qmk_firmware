Hi,

Sorry for the delay. My main problem building the Infinity firmware was that I wanted to build it using jackumbert's QMK firmware, since my Planck uses QMK firmware already and I like how the macros, makefile, etc. are set.

Building the QMK firmware for the Planck was a breeze (I've used the Vagrantfile jack provided to setup a minimal Arch setup). However, when I've tried to build the Infinity firmware from the QMK repository, it didn't work. From what I remember, the problem I was having was related to specific versions of the arm-none-eabi-gcc I was using and afterwards it was complaining about the gcc version.

After a few tries (including compiling a specific version of gcc :/ ), I gave up and returned to a clean slate.

The instructions I've created at the time were:
- Follow github.com/lejboua/qmk_firmware\keyboard\infinity_chibios\MEMO.txt (you will clone flabbergast repo using chibios (Note: use the chibios branch))
- To use some advanced features found on jackhumbert qmk_firmware like MACRODOWN and such, I updated the following files on the repo I cloned from flabbergast:

On branch chibios
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/chibios'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   .gitmodules
        new file:   tmk_core/tool/chibios/chibios

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   keyboard/infinity_chibios/Makefile
        modified:   keyboard/infinity_chibios/config.h
        modified:   keyboard/infinity_chibios/keymap_common.h

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        keyboard/infinity_chibios/keymap_lejboua.c

To upload the firmware to the infinity, I've used both Windows (following the kiibohd reccomendations, using the kii-dfu) as well as the dfu-util on Linux (if you're using Vagrant, you should first find the Product ID and Vendor ID *when* you put the keyboard in bootloader mode  (after pressing the button on the PCB)).

Here you have the files I've changed: https://www.dropbox.com/s/inb6sl1bmextwda/flabbergast-modified-files.zip?dl=0

Sorry for the late reply.

Cheers
